# PrusaSlicer M221 Per Object

**My "first" rust project. Bear with me!**

This is a very simple g-code post-processor for Prusa Slicer which enables you to change the flow rate or the extrusion multiplier per object.

## Why This Exists?

I was looking for a calibration solution working with Prusa Slicer.
I learned that there was no way to set an extrusion multiplier per object name or any other way to achieve what I wanted.

Searching the web I found this [posting](https://forum.prusa3d.com/forum/prusaslicer/change-flow-rate-extrusion-multiplier-between-objects/) but nothing else.
No solution but only the hint that there is no option in Prusa Slicer but with an exteral g-code post-processor.

(I thought that. Please see [in the documentation](docs/Documentation.md#manual-option) that this is not true.)

So I finally got to enhance my rust learning experience. :)
